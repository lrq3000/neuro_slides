Slides and documentation resources I and my colleagues presented at various events.

You can also find some of these slides with extended content (e.g., Youtube videos for the BIN2017 lecture) at https://slideshare.net/lrq3000/.

If you want to reuse in your class, please feel free to do so with proper citation (eg, "Introduction to MRI preprocessing and analysis" by Stephen Larroque, 2017, link) or please ask if you have a specific request.
