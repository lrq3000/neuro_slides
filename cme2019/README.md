# CME2019 MRI Protocol slides

There was a typo in the final slide presented at the CME2019 symposium, the slides and the protocol can be in fact found on their own github repository at: [https://github.com/lrq3000/mri_protocol](https://github.com/lrq3000/mri_protocol). Sorry for the inconvenience!
