The video "Himanshu Bansal Foundation, pre and post stem cell administration, january 2016" is not linked in the slides as it was presented live during the talk with oral description of each state of unconsciousness.

Indeed, this video is great to demonstrate how the different states of disorders of consciousness appear behaviorally, although the video itself does not include such commentary. The progression in the video is roughly linear, from UWS to EMCS and then full recovery.

This extraordinarily rare video shows a patient who went from unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (the least aware disorder of consciousness, from 0:00 to 0:37) to minimally conscious state (from 0:37 to 1:12), then emergence from minimially conscious state (from 1:12 to 2:18) and finally full recovery (2:18 to the end). The different states aren't labelled in the video but it's roughly linear and IÂ above delineated the different segments.
