The video "Himanshu Bansal Foundation, pre and post stem cell administration, january 2016" is not linked in the slides as it was presented live during the talk with oral description of each state of unconsciousness.

Indeed, this video is great to demonstrate how the different states of disorders of consciousness appear behaviorally, although the video itself does not include such commentary. The progression in the video is roughly linear, from UWS to EMCS and then full recovery.

The original video, titled "Vegetative Patient wakes up after stem cell procedure : A Hope", can be found online here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIE6EOl6ixo
